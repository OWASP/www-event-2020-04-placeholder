If you already registered for a training course, three hours prior to the beginning of the training you will receive a link to your specific training course.
You will need to enter your name and email address in order to gain access to the training room. It is important that you use the same email address that you registered with. If your email address does not match, you will not be automatically admitted into the course.

You may also receive communications from the instructor with specific requirements or pre-work for your course.
